## title
Rescales all the subtrees below some age.
## description
Makes a subtree scale move on all subtrees below a given age in the tree. Tree topology is not altered.
## details
The tree must be ultrametric.

An age is randomly drawn between the root age and the age of the oldest tip. Then all subtrees below this age are scaled up or down depending on a scaler drawn from an exponential distribution.

## example
	# We are going to save the trees we simulate in the folder simulatedTrees:
	dataFolder = "simulatedTrees/" 
	# Letâ€™s simulate a species tree with 10 taxa, 2 gene trees, 3 alleles per species:
	n_species <- 10
	n_genes <- 2
	n_alleles <- 3
	# we simulate an ultrametric species tree:
	# Species names:
	for (i in 1:n_species) {
	        species[i] <- taxon(taxonName="Species_"+i, speciesName="Species_"+i)
	}
	spTree ~ dnBirthDeath(lambda=0.3, mu=0.2, rootAge=10, rho=1, samplingStrategy="uniform", condition="nTaxa", taxa=species)
	print(spTree)
	# let's pick a constant effective population size of 50:
	popSize <- 50
	# let's simulate gene trees now:
	# taxa names:
	for (g in 1:n_genes) {
	  for (i in 1:n_species) {
	    for (j in 1:n_alleles) {
	        taxons[g][(i-1)*n_alleles+j] <- taxon(taxonName="Species_"+i+"_"+j, speciesName="Species_"+i)
	    }
	  }
	  geneTrees[g] ~ dnMultiSpeciesCoalescent(speciesTree=spTree, Ne=popSize, taxa=taxons[g])
	  print(geneTrees[g])
	}
	# We can save the species tree and the gene trees: 
	write(spTree, filename=dataFolder+"speciesTree")
	# Saving the gene trees
	for (i in 1:(n_genes)) {
	  write(geneTrees[i], filename=dataFolder+"geneTree_"+i+".tree")
	}
	# set my move index
	mi = 0

	for (i in 1:n_genes) {
	   move_species_subtree_scale.addGeneTreeVariable( geneTrees[i] )
	}
	moves[++mi] = move_species_subtree_scale
	# We get a handle on our model.
	# We can use any node of our model as a handle, here we choose to use the topology.
	mymodel = model(spTree)
	# Monitors to check the progression of the program
	monitors[1] = mnScreen(printgen=10, spTree)

	# or use mcmcmc with heated chains.
